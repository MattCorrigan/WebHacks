        <h3>What is WebHacks?</h3>
        <p>WebHacks aims to create a community of hackers from all around the globe that unite to build amazing projects. Applicants can be teamed up, and are given one week to code the most awesome website they can think of. By creating the hackathon online, our hope is to make coding competitions accessible to everyone, while still providing the full hackathon experience.</p>
